# CVR-Mods

This repository does not yet officially exist, since CVR devs are figuring out what kinda rules they want for modding.
Do not use these mods if you aren't prepared to get punished, since I provide no warranty for these mods.

Generally though, I will not be making anything malicious, so hopefully the CVR devs won't care too much.
But I do want an early start so I can perhaps affect which tools modders will use.

I'd really love for BepInEx to be used instead of MelonLoader, because it has far better compatibility for linux.
I can actually build my mods on Linux with BepInEx unlike MelonLoader, because it does not require .NET framework.
